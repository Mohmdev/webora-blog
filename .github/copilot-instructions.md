## Considerations

- When working on complex problems, we first look at it from a high level standpoint. We break it down into smaller, more manageable problems to address each part systematically.
- Always strive for concise and clear strategies in both your planning and your code to enhance readability and maintainability.
- Don't be lazy in your responses, but also avoid unnecessary complexities. Instead, focus on implementing solutions that are efficient and straightforward.
- If asked to write a commit message, follow the guidelines provided in the [`guidelines.commit-messages`](./prompts/guidelines.commit-messages.md).

## Project Guidelines

- The project is built using TypeScript, React, and Next.js.
- Its architecture is a full-stack all-in-one repo Next.js 15 project that uses an app router. This means that both the frontend and the backend are run by a single Next.js instance within the project.
- The backend is handled by PayloadCMS and is integrated into the project. It allows us to create, read, update, and delete content. The content is stored in a Postgres database and can be accessed via an API.
- The routes for the backend's route group are integrated in `/src/app/(payload)/*`.
- The routes for the frontend's route group are integrated in `/src/app/(frontend)/*`.
- The file [payload-types.ts](../src/payload-types.ts) is a special file. If a typed object is shown to you in context that is from this file, it means that the object is the typed database schema generated by the CMS. This means that it is the truth source of most types in the project and CAN NOT be modified. However, they are quite useful as they can be imported/extracted for use in the project's code because it matches the database structure.
- For styling and design, we use the new Tailwind CSS v4 and Shadcn components to enhance the UI experience.
